## About me

Just your garden-variety Aerospace and Computer Engineer. I am keenly interested in:

* Aerospace GNC;
* Dynamical systems theory;
* AI, machine learning, optimization;
* Game design;
* General tinkering and hacking.

*[GNC]: Guidance, Navigation and Control
*[AI]: Artificial Intelligence

If you also like to talk about these topics, say hi to me on social media (cute, oh-so-clickable links available on the sidebar to your {% if site.invert %}right{% else %}left{% endif %}).

## About the site

This site is built with:

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) -- great static site-building; the fact that you can use it on GitHub pages doesn't hurt, either
* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) -- nice theme/template for Jekyll
* [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome) -- glyphs for all your site-ing needs
