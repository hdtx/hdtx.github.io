      description: >
        I am responsible for developing firmware and related software for a pioneering automotive test system. It allows a huge level of customization by running tests written in a popular scripting language.<br>
        This system brings together the best of two worlds: all aspects of the test (test logic, user interface, data capture and processing, logging, comms) are fully scriptable, but it keeps the soft real-time capabilities of a 'normal' bare metal system.

        Internship in a satellite formation flying simulation lab. The vehicles used compressed air thrusters to move around the experiment area in 5 DoF (3 rotational, 2 translational).
        <ul>
          <li>Devised automated procedures for identifying key parameters in the platforms;</li>
          <li>Developed a combined attitude and position real-time control system, giving the vehicles trajectory-following capability;</li>
          <li>Built a simulation program which greatly sped up the control algorithm design process.</li>
        </ul>
        Design, implementation and testing both of the simulation and of the actual control system were performed using MATLAB (Simulink and Simulink Coder).
